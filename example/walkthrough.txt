This is a walkthrough example on the toy dataset
lines starting with # symbol are comments

1.System Requirement:
R 3.1.1 or R 3.2.2, python 2.7.10 (Rscript and python binaries are supposed to exist in system path)
We assume the current path is in HMM-TilingArray-CRC/ if the user download the whole folder from githup

2.Install dependencies
#please refer to /installation/INSTALL.md for detailed package list
cd tools/installation
Rscript install_dependencies.R

3.Differential analysis, hmm, and sliding window merge
#please refer to cirDNA_methy_hmm.R in MANUAL.txt for detailed usage information
cd ../../example/
mkdir toy_output
#Here we run cirDNA_methy_hmm.R to generate the data after feature selection, -d means we want to also generate the differential analysis result
Rscript ../tools/featureSelection/cirDNA_methy_hmm.R -i toy_dataset_1000f_train.txt -t toy_dataset_1000f_test.txt -o toy_output/toy -d
#Following comments in this section describe the output from cirDNA_methy_hmm.R
#toy_qvalue_logfc.txt contains the differential analysis result for all features provided in the training dataset
#toy_trainDiff.txt and toy_testDiff.txt are the result files after t-test based feature selection, first line in these files show the top n features
#toy_trainHMMqvalue.txt and toy_testHMMqvalue.txt are the result files after qhmm feature selection, the number of features after this step maybe less than the provided n because qhmm merge adjacent features

4.Building diagnostic classifiers based on qhmm derived features
#Here we run ML_classification.R to build random forest and gbm diagnostic classifiers based on qhmm derived features
Rscript ../tools/classification/ML_classification.R -i toy_output/toy_trainHMMqvalue.txt -t toy_output/toy_testHMMqvalue.txt -I toy_dataset_train_label.txt -T toy_dataset_test_label.txt -o toy_output/toy_qhmm -c rf,gbm
#Following comments in this section describe the output from ML_classication.R
#toy_qhmm_MLROC.pdf and all *.pdf files are pictures showing the performance of classifier and classifier tuning process
#toy_qhmm_gbm.RData and toy_qhmm_rf.RData are the actual classifer in RData format, user can load these two RData in R console and use them for later testing data

5.Building diagnostic classifiers based on t-test derived features
#We run ML_classification.R for t-test derived features and compare the classifier performance with qhmm derived features
Rscript ../tools/classification/ML_classification.R -i toy_output/toy_trainDiff.txt -t toy_output/toy_testDiff.txt -I toy_dataset_train_label.txt -T toy_dataset_test_label.txt -o toy_output/toy_ttest -c rf,gbm
#Compare toy_qhmm_MLROC.pdf and toy_ttest_MLROC.pdf
#In my machine, the ROC for qhmm and t-test features are around 70% and 60% on this toy dataset. It is very straightforward that qhmm is much more effective than t-test based filtering method.
