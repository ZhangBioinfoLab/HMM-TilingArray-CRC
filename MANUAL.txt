This is a manual for most of major programs in the tools folder
We highly encourge users to try qhmm on the toy dataset in /example folder and follow the /example/walkthrough.txt file.
The default usage manual for each program can also be found by typing:
Rscript [program.R] -h 
or python [program.py] -h

1. cirDNA_methy_hmm.R
Description: The main feature selection tool, implementing differential analysis, HMM framework, and sliding window combination algorithm, the input is the training and testing dataset, and it outputs the data after feature selection, cirDNA_methy_hmm also provides options for generating intermediate differential analysis result and hmm state result.

Usage: Rscript cirDNA_methy_hmm.R [Options]
Options:
    -i TRAINING, --training=TRAINING
        the traing data of tilling array(after normalization), txt file, please check example/toy_dataset_1000f_train.txt for detailed format, noted that the name of all control samples must be ended with string 'CTR', and feature name must contain chromosome number and its position 

    -t TESTING, --testing=TESTING
        the testing set of tilling array(after normalization), txt file, in the same format as training dataset

    -o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT
        the primary name of output file

    -d, --differentialOutput
        whether output differential analysis based on t test

    -s SEED, --seed=SEED
        the seed for reproducible research,
                    [default] = 1

    --saveMedium
        whether to save the intermediate hmm results to analyze hidden states,
                    [default] = FALSE

    --iniWin=INIWIN
        Initial window size for merging,
                    [default] = 15

    --proportion=PROPORTION
        proportion of positive states in sliding window,
                    [default] = 0.8

2. ML_classification.R
Description: Building classifiers based on SVM, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machine algorithms, ML_classification.R take in the resulting training and testing data from cirDNA_methy_hmm.R along with corresponding labels and generate diagnostic classifiers

Usage: Rscript ML_classification.R [Options]
Options:
    -i TRAINING, --training=TRAINING
        the training set, generated from cirDNA_methy_hmm.R, should be in txt, or RData format

    -t TESTING, --testing=TESTING
        the testing set, generated from cirDNA_methy_hmm.R, should be in txt, or RData format

    -I TRAININGLABEL, --trainingLabel=TRAININGLABEL
        label file for training data

    -T TESTINGLABEL, --testingLabel=TESTINGLABEL
        label file for testing data

    -o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT
        the primary name of output file

    -s SEED, --seed=SEED
        the seed, [Default] = 1

    -c CLASSIFIER, --classifier=CLASSIFIER
        choosing two or three classification algorithms from svm,rf,gbm (pls follow the order), [Default]=all

    -h, --help

3. randomProbe.R
Description: Randomly select a specified number of features from the tiling array or microarray data. The main purpose of this program is to verifying the null hypothesis that QHMM would not improve classification performance is not correct. It can also be used to simulate the random process of feature selection.

Usage: Rscript randomProbe.R [Options]
Options:
    -i TRAINING, --training=TRAINING
        the traing data of tilling array(after normalization), txt file, please check example/toy_dataset_1000f_train.txt for detailed format, noted that the name of all control samples must be ended with string 'CTR', and feature name must contain chromosome number and its position

    -t TESTING, --testing=TESTING
        the testing set of tilling array(after normalization), txt file, in the same format as training dataset

    -o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT
        the primary name of output file

    -s SEED, --seed=SEED
        the seed, [Default] = 1

    -n NUMBER, --number=NUMBER
        the number of features to retain. [DEFAULT] = 2000

    -h, --help
        Show this help message and exit

4. rfe.R
Description: This program can help the user choose appropriate number of feature size according the result from recursive feature selection. It will start with all features in the dataset and each time remove 10 least significant features, and generate a final statistics graph. Users can then decide what feature size is appropriate. The classification algorithm used to RFE is random forest. (Warning: this program may take a while to run if the size of dataset is big)

Usage: Rscript rfe.R [Options]
Options:
    -i TRAINING, --training=TRAINING
        the traing data of tilling array(after normalization), txt file, please check example/toy_dataset_1000f_train.txt for detailed format, noted that the name of all control samples must be ended with string 'CTR', and feature name must contain chromosome number and its position

    -t TESTING, --testing=TESTING
        the testing set of tilling array(after normalization), txt file, in the same format as training dataset

    -I TRAININGLABEL, --trainingLabel=TRAININGLABEL
        label file for training data

    -T TESTINGLABEL, --testingLabel=TESTINGLABEL
        label file for testing data

    -o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT
        the primary name of output file

    -s SEED, --seed=SEED
        the seed, [Default] = 1
