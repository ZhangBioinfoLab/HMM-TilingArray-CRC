#HMM-based Biomarker Discovery and Machine Learning Classifier Construction of Colorectal Cancer

##Synopsis

This repository provides all program tools and source code used in the project "HMM-based Biomarker Discovery and Machine Learning Classifer Construction of 
Colorectal Cancer". The pipeline for this project includes:
1. Data Cleaning(Preprocessing)
2. Feature Selection
3. Classification
4. Analysis
Interested users or readers can refer to the original study for further details.

##Motivation
Traditional cancer diagnosis is based on assessing the morphology of cancer cells. However, in some cancers whose cells are not easily accessible, diagnosis by cancer 
cells requires tumour biopsies and this would be a huge pain for patients. Identification of cancer-specific epigenetic DNA alterations in the cell-free circulating 
DNA (cirDNA) is a new opportunity for cancer diagnosis and screening, especially for cancers whose cells are not easily accessi- ble, such as colorectal 
cancer(CRC). Therefore, there is a critical need for new analytical methods and tools for the circulating DNA biomarker discovery research. In this project, we propose a feature selection approach called "QHMM", which is a combination of Hidden Markov Model and a sliding window approach to investigate and select diagnostic marker candidates.

##Tests and Code Examples
Here we show a typical pipeline for analyzing Tiling array data with our tools. The data we used here is a toy dataset from examples folder.


##Installation

Most of the tools used in this project are scripts running in the command line tool. No special installation is needed.

##Usage

Please refer to the MANUAL.md for detailed usage information for different tools.
